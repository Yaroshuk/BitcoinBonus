With this method, attackers lure data about your phone and register it on Bitcoin Bonus.  faced with this problem in 2021, we developed a system of IP memorization and re -registration. That is, if your phone was used by attackers to extract cryptocurrency without your consent, you can automatically rewrite the IP devices on your service and withdraw the money to the service from this phone. And the attackers will forever lose all the data from your device, and ahead of which they will no longer be able to go to your personal account"
